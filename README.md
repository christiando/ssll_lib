This code implements approximate inference methods for State-Space Analysis of
Spike Correlations (Shimazaki et al. PLoS Comp Bio 2012). It is an extension of
the existing code from repository <https://github.com/tomxsharp/ssll> (For
Matlab Code refer to <http://github.com/shimazaki/dynamic_corr>).

Exact Model:
See the original paper for mathematical details, and example_exact.py for a
demonstration of how to use the program.

Approximation Methods:
See arxiv publication <http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08840> (not peer reviewed) for
mathematical
details on approximation methods. Demonstration of approximation methods in
